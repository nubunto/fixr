# FixrBot

A nice and small Telegram Bot to aid you on currency changes. Subscribe and receive a daily update on all of the currencies updated by the Europe Central Bank.
FixrBot uses the awesome [Fixer API](http://fixer.io).

Pull requests are welcome.

## Features

FixrBot has a nice set of features. Here are its commands:

 * /setbase: Sets the base currency for calculations
 * /add: Prompts rates and adds them to daily notifications and requests
 * /clear: Clears all your rates
 * /del [rate]: Removes given rate from daily notifications and requests
 * /start: Subscribes to daily notifications 
 * /stop: Unsubscribes from daily notifications
 * /help: See this message
 * /iso: See the ISO codes of currencies in order to select which one to pass to /setbase or /add
 * /cancel: Cancel the /add command and don't change anything.

Everything is somewhat documented. In source code. I haven't done any godocs yet. Don't hate me.

If you like FixrBot, please, support it with code or beer. He won't drink, so maybe he'll give it to me, heh.
